# [Fast Food Survey]
[This app asks the user their personal favorite out of four chain fast-food restaurants. The website then tells the user my opinion on their choice because I want to add my two cents and I passionately hate Burger King. Then, the user is asked to submit their favorite menu item for their favorite restaurant, and the submit button takes them to the final page where they can return home. ]
